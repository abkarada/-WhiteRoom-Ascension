# Architect's Protocol

### Rule 1 - No Blind Consumption
No ready-made functions, no libraries, no unnecessary dependencies.  
Every function and algorithm must be understood down to its core essence before I write a single line of code.

### Rule 2 - From Metal to Mind
I don't just write code — I start from the metal and trace every bit of data flow to its final destination.  
Hardware, networking, cryptography, operating systems — they all belong to me.

### Rule 3 - Secure by Design
Every line of code I write, every protocol I design, every system I build — security is baked into the architecture.  
I don’t patch vulnerabilities — I eliminate them at design time.

### Rule 4 - Protocol is my Religion
TCP, IP, UDP, ICMP, TLS, HTTP — these are my sacred scriptures.  
I dissect every packet, I memorize every header, I worship the flow.

### Rule 5 - Legacy Codes are Coffins
I do not fear legacy code — I bury it and resurrect it with my own architecture.  
I do not refactor; I reconstruct from the ground up.
